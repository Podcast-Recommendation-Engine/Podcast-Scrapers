# Kafka 3-Broker Cluster Setup

## Overview

In this repository, you are tasked with setting up a **Kafka cluster with 3 brokers**. You should provide **comprehensive documentation** that details **all steps required to manually configure Kafka**, including configuration files, environment settings, and any required system adjustments.

Additionally, if possible, provide a **script (`.sh`) or a modular Ansible playbook** (preferably using **Ansible Galaxy roles**) to automate the deployment and configuration of the Kafka cluster.

## Documentation Requirements

The documentation should clearly explain:

* Cluster architecture and broker roles
* Configuration parameters for each broker
* Steps for starting, stopping, and monitoring the cluster
* Any prerequisites or dependencies
