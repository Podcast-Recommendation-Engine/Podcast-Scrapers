# Podcast-Recommendation-API

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to implementing the **API layer for the Podcast Recommendation Platform**. The API is responsible for **capturing and managing user interactions and activity logs**, which are essential for personalized recommendations.

The API should handle events such as:  
- User subscriptions to channels or podcasts  
- Likes and dislikes  
- Podcast play history  
- Other relevant user actions  

These logs will feed into the recommendation engine to improve accuracy and relevance.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for user interactions  
- Logging of user activity for recommendation purposes  
- Integration with backend services or databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka)  
- Scalable and modular design for future expansion  

## Documentation Requirements

The documentation should clearly explain:

* API endpoints and their purposes  
* Data models and schema for user actions  
* Steps to deploy and run the API  
* How to integrate the API with the recommendation engine  
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms
