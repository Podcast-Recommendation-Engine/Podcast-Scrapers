# Podcast-Recommendation-API

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to implementing the **API layer for the Podcast Recommendation Platform**.  
The API is responsible for **capturing and managing user interactions and activity logs**, which serve as the foundation for the recommendation engine.

It should be designed to **store data in MongoDB** for persistence and **cache frequently accessed data in Redis** to ensure high performance and low latency.

The API should handle events such as:  
- User subscriptions to channels or podcasts  
- Likes and dislikes  
- Podcast play and listen history  
- Follows, unfollows, and other user actions  

These interactions are used to generate personalized podcast recommendations.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for user interactions  
- **MongoDB integration** for storing user actions and metadata  
- **Redis caching** for improving API performance and reducing database load  
- Logging of all user activities for recommendation analysis  
- Scalable, modular, and easy-to-extend design  
- Kafka integration for streaming user events

## Documentation Requirements

The documentation should clearly explain:

* API endpoints and their expected request/response formats  
* Data models and MongoDB schema design  
* Redis caching logic and expiration policies  
* Deployment steps and environment configuration  
* Integration flow with the recommendation engine  
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms
