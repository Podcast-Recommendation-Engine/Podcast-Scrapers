# Ceph Cluster Setup

## Overview

In this repository, you are tasked with setting up a **Ceph cluster**. You should provide **comprehensive documentation** that details **all steps required to manually configure Ceph**, including configuration files, environment settings, and any required system adjustments.

Additionally, if possible, provide a **script (`.sh`) or a modular Ansible playbook** (preferably using **Ansible Galaxy roles**) to automate the deployment and configuration of the Ceph cluster.

## Documentation Requirements

The documentation should clearly explain:

* Cluster architecture and node roles (MON, OSD, MDS, RGW)
* Configuration parameters for each node
* Steps for starting, stopping, and monitoring the cluster
* Any prerequisites or dependencies (network, storage devices, OS requirements)
* Guidelines for scaling the cluster and adding/removing nodes
